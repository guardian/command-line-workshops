# Command Line Workshops

These workshops are designed to get developers comfortable working on the command line. Along the way we will cover different tools and fundamentals, including:

- Shells and Shortcuts 
- Processes and Daemons 
- Debugging and Profiling 
- Virtualisation and Concurrency
- VIM

Each workshop is an hour long, and designed to be a mixture of theory and practice. The scope of each workshop is larger than what can be reasonably covered in the time allocated. The idea is to ground you in a topic, build some foundations, and give guidance on where you might want to spend further time researching.

Each workshop is led by facilitators, not teachers. There will be self-learning, group learning, and pair programming. The facilitators are there to help you when you get stuck, and to guide you in the right direction.
