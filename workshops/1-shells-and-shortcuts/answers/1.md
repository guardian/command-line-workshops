### 1. What is an operating system?

An operating system can be thought of as:

* the software that manages and allocates computer resources - also known as the **kernel**
* the kernel along with other tools (e.g. command-line interpreters, graphical user interfaces,  file utilities, and
  editors)

The operating system turns hardware problems into software abstractions, providing order and control over resources which have competing demands. If multiple programs or users are trying to use the same resources, the operating system can prevent conflicts and ensure things run smoothly.
