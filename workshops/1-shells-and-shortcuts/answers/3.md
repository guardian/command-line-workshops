### 3. How do I use the shell?
#### What is a prompt?
The prompt is the text that appears in the terminal to indicate that the shell is ready to accept commands. It usually includes some information about the current working directory and the user.

#### How do I run a command?
Type a command and press enter.

#### What is sudo?
Some commands cannot be run unless you are the admin user (or super user) on your machine. `sudo` is a command that allows you to run (or 'do') a command as the super user ('su', hence 'sudo').

#### What are the basic commands I need to know?
* `cd`
* `ls`
* `pwd`
* `cat`
* `echo`
* `touch`
* `mkdir`
* `rm`

#### How do I find out more about a command? (man pages, tldr)
You can use the `man` command to read the manual page for a command. You can also use the `tldr` command to get a quick summary of a command (as the man pages can be quite long).

Commands usually have different flags (usually one dash, `-`) and options (usually two dashes, `--`) that extend or modify the behaviour of the command.

#### How do I search for recent commands?

You can use the shortcut 'CTRL' + 'R' to search for recent commands. You can also use the `history` command to see a list of recent commands.
