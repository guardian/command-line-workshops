## Answers

This directory contains some answers to the questions posed in the workshop. 

If you are currently in a workshop, please **STOP READING**!

These answers are for reference _after_ the workshop (or if you are working through the workshop asynchronously and get stuck).

These answers are not definitive. We encourage you to do your own research to supplement them.

We also encourage you to make your own notes, as you are more likely to remember things you write down yourself.
