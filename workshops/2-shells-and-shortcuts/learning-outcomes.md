## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to answer the following questions:
1. [How can I use shortcuts to quickly navigate on the command line?](./intro.md#1-how-can-i-use-shortcuts-to-quickly-navigate-on-the-command-line)
2. [What command line tools can I use to process text?](./intro.md#2-what-command-line-tools-can-i-use-to-process-text)

This week's workshop should also consolidate the learning outcomes of the [previous workshop](../1-shells-and-shortcuts/learning-outcomes.md).
