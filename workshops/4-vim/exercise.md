### Exercise

Today's exercise is outsourced. Choose from the following options:

* vimtutor (should be installed on your machine)
* [OpenVim](https://www.openvim.com/)
* [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
* [Other VIM interactive exercises](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+vim+website)

The best way to learn VIM is to experience it. So, try to use it as much as possible. 

If you are stuck, use the `:help` command to get help, or ask the group.
